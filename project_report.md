# **Introduction**
  To fullfil the requirements for deliverable 4, Group 28 used the Django Framework to render the html files developed in deliverable 1.  The team installed Django framework in a python virtual environment, created new projects and apps and configured the files to the initial views and controllers, saving the models for a later deliverable.  During the process, the team had occasion to make some design revisions to take advantage of Django specific features adding a base template that was then extended to other templates to render the home.html, signin.html, and signup.html pages.  While there were some modifications to the original design, they improved the usability and reduced the amount of code required to implement the solution.
